# Book Volume Organiser
Organises book volumes with pages split into different folders into one folder with helpful file naming.

To see an applicable use of this tool, look at [my process for creating EPUB 3 digital manga](https://gist.github.com/KojoBailey/722d0f599a2279a6bee24ba07eaf2728), which is the whole reason I made this tool in the first place.

## Usage
All you need to do is gather the folders you want to merge, put them all into one folder, and then drag that folder onto the tool's `.exe` file. Then, just wait for a few seconds, and a folder titled "**Organised Volume**" will show up with all the files inside, together.

To break down the naming scheme, take `Ch4-19 (103).png` for example, which means "**Chapter 4**, **Page 19**, **Page 103 in total**". This is so it's easy to tell when one chapter stars and ends, as well as keep track of the total page count.
